README for mm-of-the-moment:

https://www.ozlabs.org/~akpm/mmotm/

This is a snapshot of my -mm patch queue.  Uploaded at random hopefully
more than once a week.

You will need quilt to apply these patches to the latest Linus release (5.x
or 5.x-rcY).  The series file is in broken-out.tar.gz and is duplicated in
https://ozlabs.org/~akpm/mmotm/series

The file broken-out.tar.gz contains two datestamp files: .DATE and
.DATE-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.  Both contain the string yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss,
followed by the base kernel version against which this patch series is to
be applied.

This tree is partially included in linux-next.  To see which patches are
included in linux-next, consult the `series' file.  Only the patches
within the #NEXT_PATCHES_START/#NEXT_PATCHES_END markers are included in
linux-next.


A full copy of the full kernel tree with the linux-next and mmotm patches
already applied is available through git within an hour of the mmotm
release.  Individual mmotm releases are tagged.  The master branch always
points to the latest release, so it's constantly rebasing.

The directory https://www.ozlabs.org/~akpm/mmots/ (mm-of-the-second)
contains daily snapshots of the -mm tree.  It is updated more frequently
than mmotm, and is untested.

A git copy of this tree is also available at
