Subject: Make sure nobody's leaking resources

Currently, releasing a resource also releases all of its children.  That
made sense when request_resource was the main method of dividing up the
memory map.  With the increased use of insert_resource, it seems to me that
we should instead reparent the newly orphaned resources.  Before we do
that, let's make sure that nobody's actually relying on the current
semantics.
