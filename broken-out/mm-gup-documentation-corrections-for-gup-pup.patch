Subject: mm/gup: documentation corrections for gup/pup

Patch series "A few gup refactorings and documentation updates", v3.

While reviewing some of the other things going on around gup.c, I noticed
that the documentation was wrong for a few of the routines that I wrote. 
And then I noticed that there was some significant code duplication too. 
So this fixes those issues.

This is not entirely risk-free, but after looking closely at this, I think
it's actually a useful improvement, getting rid of the code duplication
here.


This patch (of 3):

The documentation for try_grab_compound_head() and try_grab_page() has
fallen a little out of date.  Update and clarify a few points.

Also make it kerneldoc-correct, by adding @args documentation.
