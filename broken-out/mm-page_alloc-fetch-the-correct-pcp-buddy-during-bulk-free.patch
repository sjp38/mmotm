Subject: mm/page_alloc: fetch the correct pcp buddy during bulk free

Patch series "Follow-up on high-order PCP caching", v2.

Commit 44042b449872 ("mm/page_alloc: allow high-order pages to be stored
on the per-cpu lists") was primarily aimed at reducing the cost of SLUB
cache refills of high-order pages in two ways.  Firstly, zone lock
acquisitions was reduced and secondly, there were fewer buddy list
modifications.  This is a follow-up series fixing some issues that became
apparant after merging.

Patch 1 is a functional fix. It's harmless but inefficient.

Patches 2-5 reduce the overhead of bulk freeing of PCP pages.  While the
overhead is small, it's cumulative and noticable when truncating large
files.  The changelog for patch 4 includes results of a microbench that
deletes large sparse files with data in page cache.  Sparse files were
used to eliminate filesystem overhead.

Patch 6 addresses issues with high-order PCP pages being stored on PCP
lists for too long.  Pages freed on a CPU potentially may not be quickly
reused and in some cases this can increase cache miss rates.  Details are
included in the changelog.


This patch (of 6):

free_pcppages_bulk() prefetches buddies about to be freed but the order
must also be passed in as PCP lists store multiple orders.
