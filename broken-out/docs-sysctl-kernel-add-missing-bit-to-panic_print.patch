Subject: docs: sysctl/kernel: add missing bit to panic_print

Patch series "Some improvements on panic_print".

This is a mix of a documentation fix with some additions to the
"panic_print" syscall / parameter.  The goal here is being able to collect
all CPUs backtraces during a panic event and also to enable "panic_print"
in a kdump event - details of the reasoning and design choices in the
patches.


This patch (of 3):

Commit de6da1e8bcf0 ("panic: add an option to replay all the printk
message in buffer") added a new bit to the sysctl/kernel parameter
"panic_print", but the documentation was added only in
kernel-parameters.txt, not in the sysctl guide.

Fix it here by adding bit 5 to sysctl admin-guide documentation.
