Subject: kasan, vmalloc: drop outdated VM_KASAN comment

The comment about VM_KASAN in include/linux/vmalloc.c is outdated. 
VM_KASAN is currently only used to mark vm_areas allocated for kernel
modules when CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC is disabled.

Drop the comment.

- * If IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC), VM_KASAN is set on a vm_struct after
