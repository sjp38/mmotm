Subject: bitfield: add explicit inclusions to the example

It's not obvious that bitfield.h doesn't guarantee the bits.h inclusion
and the example in the former is confusing.  Some developers think that
it's okay to just include bitfield.h to get it working.  Change example to
explicitly include necessary headers in order to avoid confusion.

Fixes: 3e9b3112ec74 ("add basic register-field manipulation macros")
