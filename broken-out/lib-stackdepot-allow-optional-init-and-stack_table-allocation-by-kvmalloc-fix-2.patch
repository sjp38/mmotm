Subject: lib/stackdepot: allow optional init and stack_table allocation by kvmalloc() - fixup

On FLATMEM, we call page_ext_init_flatmem_late() just before
kmem_cache_init() which means stack_depot_init() (called by page owner
init) will not recognize properly it should use kvmalloc() and not
memblock_alloc().  memblock_alloc() will also not issue a warning and
return a block memory that can be invalid and cause kernel page fault when
saving stacks, as reported by the kernel test robot [1].

Fix this by moving page_ext_init_flatmem_late() below kmem_cache_init() so
that slab_is_available() is true during stack_depot_init().  SPARSEMEM
doesn't have this issue, as it doesn't do page_ext_init_flatmem_late(),
but a different page_ext_init() even later in the boot process.

Thanks to Mike Rapoport for pointing out the FLATMEM init ordering issue.

While at it, also actually resolve a checkpatch warning in stack_depot_init()
from DRM CI, which was supposed to be in the original patch already.
