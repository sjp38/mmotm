Subject: mm: protect free_pgtables with mmap_lock write lock in exit_mmap

oom-reaper and process_mrelease system call should protect against races
with exit_mmap which can destroy page tables while they walk the VMA tree.
oom-reaper protects from that race by setting MMF_OOM_VICTIM and by
relying on exit_mmap to set MMF_OOM_SKIP before taking and releasing
mmap_write_lock.  process_mrelease has to elevate mm->mm_users to prevent
such race.

Both oom-reaper and process_mrelease hold mmap_read_lock when walking the
VMA tree.  The locking rules and mechanisms could be simpler if exit_mmap
takes mmap_write_lock while executing destructive operations such as
free_pgtables.

Change exit_mmap to hold the mmap_write_lock when calling unlock_range,
free_pgtables and remove_vma.  Note also that because oom-reaper checks
VM_LOCKED flag, unlock_range() should not be allowed to race with it.

Before this patch, remove_vma used to be called with no locks held,
however with fput being executed asynchronously and vm_ops->close not
being allowed to hold mmap_lock (it is called from __split_vma with
mmap_sem held for write), changing that should be fine.

In most cases this lock should be uncontended.  Previously, Kirill
reported ~4% regression caused by a similar change [1].  We reran the same
test and although the individual results are quite noisy, the percentiles
show lower regression with 1.6% being the worst case [2].  The change
allows oom-reaper and process_mrelease to execute safely under
mmap_read_lock without worries that exit_mmap might destroy page tables
from under them.
