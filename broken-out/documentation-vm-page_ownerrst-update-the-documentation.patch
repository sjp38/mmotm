    By default, ``page_owner_sort`` is sorted according to the times of buf.
    If you want to sort by the pages nums of buf, use the ``-m`` parameter.
+   The detail parameters are shown as follows:
+
+   fundamental function:
+
+	Sort:
+		-a		Sort by memory allocate time.
+		-m		Sort by total memory.
+		-p		Sort by pid.
+		-r		Sort by memory release time.
+		-s		Sort by the stack trace.
+		-t		Sort by times (default).
+
+   additional function:
+
+	Cull:
+		-c		Cull by comparing stacktrace instead of total block.
+
+	Filter:
+		-f		Filter out the information of blocks whose memory has not been released.
