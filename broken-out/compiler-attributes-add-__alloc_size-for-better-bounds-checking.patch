Subject: Compiler Attributes: add __alloc_size() for better bounds checking

Patch series "Add __alloc_size() for better bounds checking", v2.

GCC and Clang both use the "alloc_size" attribute to assist with bounds
checking around the use of allocation functions.  Add the attribute,
adjust the Makefile to silence needless warnings, and add the hints to the
allocators where possible.  These changes have been in use for a while now
in GrapheneOS.


This patch (of 2):

GCC and Clang can use the "alloc_size" attribute to better inform the
results of __builtin_object_size() (for compile-time constant values). 
Clang can additionally use alloc_size to inform the results of
__builtin_dynamic_object_size() (for run-time values).

Because GCC sees the frequent use of struct_size() as an allocator size
argument, and notices it can return SIZE_MAX (the overflow indication), it
complains about these call sites may overflow (since SIZE_MAX is greater
than the default -Walloc-size-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX).  This isn't
helpful since we already know a SIZE_MAX will be caught at run-time (this
was an intentional design).  Instead, just disable this check as it is
both a false positive and redundant.  (Clang does not have this warning
option.)
